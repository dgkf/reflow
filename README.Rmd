# reflow

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-experimental-red)

An experimental linter and formatter designed as a syntax pattern matching DSL. 

## Status

Right now this is entirely a proof of concept. The examples may break or change
as the package develops, and there are no guarantees that this will ever mature
into something stable. 

## Goals

- Make syntax styles easier to express, validate and apply
- Apply style logic in a minimal traversal of the syntax tree. 
- Make composition of styles easy, built upon minimal rules

## Examples

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(reflow)
options(reflow.quiet = FALSE)

rs <- rules(
  "expr" = rule(
    msg = "multiline expressions should be indented by one level",
    "{",
    ws(nl = 1),
    indent(zero_or_more(any_token(), until = "}")),
    ws(nl = 1),
    "}"
  )
)

match_style(rs, "
test <- function() {
   1 + 2L
  {
     1 + 2
  }
}
")
```

```{}
<<text> 3:4>
1▕
2▕ test <- function() {
3▕    1 + 2L
      ^
multiline expressions should be indented by one level

<<text> 5:6>
3▕    1 + 2L
4▕   {
5▕      1 + 2
        ^
multiline expressions should be indented by one level

```
